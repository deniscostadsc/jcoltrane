All the source code is under src directory.

All the examples used through tutorial can be found in examples directory.

To use the framework in another Java Projects, the user must only copy the file JColtrane 1.0 bet.jar to its project and point the ClassPath to it.

To use the jar file the user must have instaled JVM 1.5 or latter, once it uses Annotations.

The projetc was built in Eclipse plataform, so it can be directly imported like a project into it.
